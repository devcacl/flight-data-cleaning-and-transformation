# ✈️ Flight Data Cleaning and Transformation

This repository contains a complete **data cleaning and data transformation pipeline** applied to a real-world flight dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**.

The project was developed as part of academic activities focused on **Data Science**, covering the full preprocessing workflow from raw data to a fully transformed dataset ready for analysis and machine learning.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Explore and understand the structure of a real flight dataset  
- Identify common data quality issues:
  - Missing values
  - Duplicated records
  - Incorrect data types
  - Outliers
  - Inconsistent categorical values
- Apply appropriate **data cleaning techniques** with justification  
- Perform **data transformations** to improve analytical and predictive performance  
- Preserve original data while generating clean and transformed versions

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process includes:

- Handling missing values (imputation)
- Removing duplicate records
- Data type correction (dates and numerics)
- Outlier detection and removal using the IQR method
- Standardization of column names
- Generation of a clean dataset (`flight_cleaned.csv`)

---

## 🔄 Data Transformation

The transformation stage applies:

- Feature engineering (`loyalty_months`)
- Log transformation and Min-Max normalization
- Age discretization (bins and quantiles)
- Categorical encoding (One-Hot and Label Encoding)
- Creation of a fully transformed dataset (`flight_transformed_complete.csv`)
